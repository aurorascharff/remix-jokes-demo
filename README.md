# Remix Jokes Demo

This is a modified version of [Remix Jokes](https://github.com/remix-run/examples/tree/main/_official-jokes) that uses the more features of Remix to enable pending UI, zod for schema validation, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Prisma Setup

Add a `.env` file to the root of the project, refer to `.env.sample` for the required environment variables.
You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

After switching, delete the `prisma/migrations` folder before running the migration command.

When using sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```

When using sqllite, initialize with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
